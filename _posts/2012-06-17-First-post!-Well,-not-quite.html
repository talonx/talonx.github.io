Just moved this blog to my own domain here from <a href="http://www.jroller.com/">JRoller</a>. I can't think of any good reason why I had kept it there so long. JRoller does not score on any points - be it reliability of the server, ease of editing posts or look and feel.<br/><br/>All my old entries remain there - at <a title="http://www.jroller.com/talonx" href="http://www.jroller.com/talonx" target="_blank">http://www.jroller.com/talonx</a>.
