<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/careers/puzzles.php?puzzle_id=17" target="_blank">This puzzle</a> from Facebook's engineering puzzles page is a good introduction to string matching.<br />A solution is possible using an algorithm called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance" target="_blank">Levenshtein distance</a>.<br /><br />Let's take the example on the puzzle page -<br /><blockquote><i>TIHS SENTENTCNES ISS NOUT VARRRY GOUD</i></blockquote><br />It's a munged up version of<blockquote><i>THIS SENTENCE IS NOT VERY GOOD</i></blockquote>The original problem statement involves minimizing the score (number of changes necessary) to transform each word in the munged up sentence into words that are in a predefined <a href="http://www.facebook.com/jobs_puzzles/twl06.txt" target="_blank">wordlist</a>. It says nothing about grammatical correctness of the result.<br /><br />So going by that, the score and the output sentence from my <a href="https://github.com/talonx/python-scribbles/blob/master/fb/breathalyzer.py" target="_blank">implementation</a> are respectively, 8 and<br /><blockquote><i>TICS SENTENCES IDS NOT VAGARY GAUD</i></blockquote><br />From the standpoint of the original problem, this solution is correct. <br />But not from a grammatical point of view. After some poking around, I realized it's not possible for this program to spew out the correct version of the sentence without it being aware of English grammar rules. <br /><br /><br /><b>P.S. </b>Without getting into grammar correction, of which I have no idea how to implement, I made a small change in the program as an experiment. The <a href="https://github.com/talonx/python-scribbles/blob/master/fb/breathalyzer2.py" target="_blank">second version</a> favours a smaller word whenever the scores for two are equal.<br />And the result is (Score remains the same)<br /><blockquote><i>TIS SENTENCES IS NOT VARY GOD</i></blockquote></div>
