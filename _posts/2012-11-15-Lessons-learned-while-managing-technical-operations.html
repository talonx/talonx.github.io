...for a cloud based SaaS product, and which might be useful to you if you’re doing the same.<br>
<ul>
	<li>
There  is no substitute to knowing your fundamentals. Whatever you’re managing  - your own datacenter or a suite of apps on a public cloud - you have  to know your Operating Systems, your Computer Networking, your Linux,  your VMs.</li>
<li>Know  your tools. Find out what tools you need to monitor, maintain and debug  your systems. Know how they work, keep up with updates and play with  them often. It will save you time when the crisis hits.</li>
<li>Know  one editor and know it well - vim, emacs or other. Know all common shortcuts,  complicated copying pasting routines, tips and tricks - in times of  crisis, every second counts.</li>
<li>Learn  a little every day. Share what you learn even if you think nobody’s  listening. Soon you’ll find like minded people you can share ideas  with.</li>
<li>Visibility to other teams of what you’re doing is very important. Graph it, present it, blog and talk about it.</li>
<li>Try  to fill your team with the right people. The best people in technical  operations have an eye for detail who do not lose sight of the big  picture. They are good split-second decision makers and are experts in  prioritizing in times of crises. And of course, they know their stuff or  are smart enough to figure it out if they don’t.</li>
<li>Know your industry. Study what others are doing, and why.</li>
<li>Keep  up to date. Know what is new in your field - subscribe to the best  newsletters, RSS feeds, podcasts and conferences. There is a lot of  noise, so take out the time to sift to the useful parts, adopt what is good  for your operations and forget the rest. </li>
<li>Keep  an open mind. Fads will come and go, old ideas will be repackaged and  sold with a new coating every few years. Whatever be the case, keep up  with trends - they always have something to teach.</li>
<li>Know  your organization’s business. Interface and build relationships with  all teams. If you cut away the trappings of the DevOps movement, the  most important point that remains is collaboration. How you achieve it  depends on you.</li></ul>
