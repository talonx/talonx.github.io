This blog is about my experiences in the software industry. <br><br>
Apart from figuring out how to write successful software, I also like staying fit, playing the violin, buying more books than I can ever read and spending time with my 2 dogs.<br><br>
My tech interests lie in product development, distributed systems, computer networks, cloud computing, TechOps tools and transformations and working in focused engineering teams.

I am also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hrishikeshbarua).
