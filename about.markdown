This blog is about my experience in the software industry and what I find interesting. <br><br>
My software interests lie in product development, distributed systems, computer networks, cloud computing, machine learning, 
TechOps tools and transformations and working in focused engineering teams. Apart from figuring out how to write successful software, 
I also like staying fit, playing the violin, buying more books than I can ever read and spending time with my 2 dogs. <br>

My non-software subjects of interest include - apart from music - history (ancient/medieval/modern) and linguistics.
Usually, I am able to focus on only one of these at a time. I write about my other interests at [https://www.hrishikeshbarua.com](https://www.hrishikeshbarua.com).
